            why focus on the negative when we can throw on our snow boots and go
            out to enjoy the beautiful snowy weather.

          <h3>The mountains are calling and I must go</h3>
          <p>
            I see every person as a mountain of sorts; we can see how they look
            from afar, but will never know them until we explore.

          <h3>To live in a gingerbread house</h3>
          <p>
            A home is the physical embodiment of the people who inhabit it, so
            it's no wonder that it's such a special place for so many.
